# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  I created an app for Chada Tech for other companies to utilize as clientele. I created a clock app, a calculator app and an inventory app.
  
# What did you do particularly well?
  I felt my structure was very nicely laid out. As well as having good naming conventions for my applications.
  
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I could enhance my code by making it more efficient. I was writing the same code over and over in some portions, especially for the menu parts for all the apps.
  
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I tend to reference StackOverflow and a lot of free C++ learning sources to see if I was writing my code as efficiently as possbile using proper terms and variables.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
  I think I will use creating pseudo-code for all my future projects. Having an outline made writing code much more manageable when I was able to write down and reference my thoughts.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I found making detailed comments at the top of the block of code explainging what is happening really made it readable and adaptable. This will allow me to easily find the parts I want to change.
